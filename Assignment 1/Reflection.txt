For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (i.e. anything in the lectures to date, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting, or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.

So far in COMP103 we have covered collections and their interfaces 
(and their implementations). I now see how these ArrayLists that I have 
been using for so long relate to lists and to collections. We have also 
looked at primitive types like ints and how you cant treat them like objects.

I struggled with this assignment and enlisted help from a friend and tutors 
(commented in the code where there ideas were used). The algorithms for 
moving all tiles to the left or right made intuitive sense but when implemented 
in code didn't work like I wanted them to although the merging two equal tiles 
into one was fine. I got help from the tutors on creating a new tile where I have
never been exposed to a "do while" loop which meant I could keep trying new 
tiles until I found a blank one where I would insert a new tile(2 or a 4).

My next step in getting comfortable with Arrays and primitive types is to look 
at the model answers when they are released and look at how the full version 
of 2048 and the spiral thing were done because I couldn't even write pseudocode 
for those parts.
