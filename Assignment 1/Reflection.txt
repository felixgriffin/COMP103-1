For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (i.e. anything in the lectures to date, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting, or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.
