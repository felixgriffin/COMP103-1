COMP 103 Assignment 3 
Report on ArraySet and SortedArraySet testing and benchmarking

Name:
ID:

Testing:
--------
Which test methods failed for your implementations?
 
- ArraySet:







- SortedArraySet:







Performance Benchmarking:
-------------------------
What were the results of your timing tests?

Give the time to load the dictionary and the time to check the story, for 
  - SortedArraySet, ArraySet, and HashSet, and
  - dictionaryUnsorted.txt and dictionarySorted.txt. 

Present the results, in the table below. 
Provide times in seconds.

ArraySet                       load | check (seconds)
    dictionarySorted          ..... | ......  
    dictionaryUnsorted        ..... | ......

SortedArraySet                 load | check (seconds)
    dictionarySorted          ..... | ......  
    dictionaryUnsorted        ..... | ......

HashSet                        load | check (seconds)
    dictionarySorted          ..... | ......  
    dictionaryUnsorted        ..... | ......


Discussion:
-----------
Discuss the measurements, pointing out any interesting or unexpected results, and try to give explanations for the results. In particular, consider the following questions:

- How can you explain the differences in performance for the various implementations? 

- How can you explain the differences in performance with respect to the two versions of the dictionary?

In your answers, make reference to the sub-results for
"loading the dictionary" and "checking the story".
