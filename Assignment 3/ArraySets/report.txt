COMP 103 Assignment 3 
Report on ArraySet and SortedArraySet testing and benchmarking

Testing:
--------
Which test methods failed for your implementations?
 
- ArraySet:

N/A





- SortedArraySet:

N/A





Performance Benchmarking:
-------------------------
What were the results of your timing tests?

Give the time to load the dictionary and the time to check the story, for 
  - SortedArraySet, ArraySet, and HashSet, and
  - dictionaryUnsorted.txt and dictionarySorted.txt. 

Present the results, in the table below. 
Provide times in seconds.

ArraySet                       load | check (seconds)
    dictionarySorted          144.691 | 84.325
    dictionaryUnsorted        152.772 | 84.068

SortedArraySet                 load | check (seconds)
    dictionarySorted          152.865 | 87.833  
    dictionaryUnsorted       3754.341 | 519.017

HashSet                        load | check (seconds)
    dictionarySorted          0.194 | 0.197 
    dictionaryUnsorted        0.217 | 0.220


Discussion:
-----------
Discuss the measurements, pointing out any interesting or unexpected results, and try to give explanations for the results. In particular, consider the following questions:

- How can you explain the differences in performance for the various implementations? 

ArraySet was inifficient because the best complexity class it could be in is O(n) so with a large number of elements in the array
like when parsing a dictionary it becomes very slow. Sorted ArraySet was surprsingly slow and seemed to be O(n!) when 
parsing the unsorted dictionary which leads me to believe something was very wrong with my implementation even though
it passed the unit tests.

- How can you explain the differences in performance with respect to the two versions of the dictionary?

There seem to be many inefficiencies with adding elements, sorting and checking it an item is already in the array for Sorted
ArraySet because the time it took is orders of magnitude more than what it should be. When looking at data that was already sorted
however I was getting results similar to that of the standard ArraySet which is still much worse than what it should be but it wasn't
as bad as the unsorted dictionary.

In your answers, make reference to the sub-results for
"loading the dictionary" and "checking the story".
